# Slot Machine

This project implements a simple Slot Machine game using React. The goal is to match specific combinations of figures to win prizes. Here are some important points to keep in mind:

- If two identical figures appear on the slots, ‚Ç¨50 is added to the jackpot.
- If three identical figures appear on the slots, ‚Ç¨100 is added to the jackpot.
- There is a jackpot that accumulates ‚Ç¨5 every time no winning combination occurs.
- To win the jackpot, you need to get a combination of three üçá (grape) figures. When this combination appears, the player wins the current jackpot amount plus the accumulated jackpot.
- To start a new game, click on the "Reset" button.
